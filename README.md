# Sort Algorithms Visualiser

The tools used in this project: React.js, Redux.js

This project is built to help visualize the sorting logic of various sorting algorithms and 
improve the understanding through visuals

## Sorting Algorithms used in this project:

### Bubble Sort
One of the simple sorting algorithms works by looping through the array and comparing two adjacent elements. If the elements are in the wrong order, the algorithm will swap them and move to the next pair of elements to repeat the process until all elements are in the correct order.

### Insertion Sort
 One of the simple sorting algorithms works by splitting the array into two parts - sorted and unsorted. It places an unsorted element at a suitable place in the sorted part by moving every element in front of it until it ends up at the right position in the sorted array.

### Selection Sort
 The algorithm works by searching in the unsorted part of the array for the minimum element and placing it at the beginning of the array.

### Merge Sort
 The algorithm of the divide and conquer strategy. It recursively divides the array into two parts in the middle until it cannot divide further, and then it combines the divided parts in the sorted order. The algorithm sorts each divided part and then merges them until it gets the sorted array.

### Quick Sort
 The algorithm of the divide and conquer strategy. It picks a random pivot from the array and performs partitioning - it places all elements smaller than the pivot on the left side from it and larger ones on the 
right side from it.
